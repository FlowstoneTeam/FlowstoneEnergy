On TS and in chat my name is 'founderio' most of the time, you should recognize me.

You can best reach me via mail, most often on Mo-Fr 18-23:00 Middle European Time
Sometimes I'm on TS or Hang out in #taam and possibly other channels on esper.net
If you need more textures just message me, I can sneak some work time into my schedule here and there.
